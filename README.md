[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/8hobbies/typedoc-plugin-404) | [GitHub](https://github.com/8hobbies/typedoc-plugin-404)

This plugin generates a `404.html` at the root of the documents generated by
[TypeDoc][]. `404.html` is a location for storing the 404 page that are
recognized by web hosts such as [GitHub Pages][] and [GitLab Pages][].

## Install

```
npm install --save-dev @8hobbies/typedoc-plugin-404
```

## Usage

Pass `--plugin @8hobbies/typedoc-plugin-404` when invoking the typedoc command:

```
typedoc --plugin @8hobbies/typedoc-plugin-404
```

Or add the plugin to your `typedoc.json` file:

```
// typedoc.json
{
  "plugin": ["@8hobbies/typedoc-plugin-404"]
}
```

## Configuration

This plugin recognizes a `page404Content` option in your `typedoc.json`. You can specify custom
content that shows up in the 404 page:

```json
{
  "page404Content": "This page does not exist."
}
```

The default value is `"404 Page Not Found"`. The content can be HTML. The content is always wrapped
with `"<div class="404-content"></div>"` in the HTML output.

Alternatively, check out [this blog post][] for a detailed tutorial.

### Use with the Default Theme

If you use this plugin with the default theme, you will need to replace asset paths in 404.html with
absolute paths, otherwise user visiting non-existent pages in subfolders will not retrieve the right
asset paths. This can be achieved by:

1. Installing `replace-in-files-cli`:

   ```shell
   npm install --save-dev replace-in-files-cli
   ```

2. Run the replacement after `typedoc`. In your `package.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "doc": "typedoc && replace-in-files --string '=\"assets/' --replacement '=\"/assets/' docs/404.html"
     }
   }
   ```

## Live Example

[The document of this plugin](https://typedoc-404.8hob.io) itself is a live example.
Visit [its 404 page](https://typedoc-404.8hob.io/404.html) or type in a random path from
that domain to check out.
